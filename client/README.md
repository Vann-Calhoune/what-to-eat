# What 2 Eat Full Stack Application

I wanted to create a project to better my understanding of SQL. This project has full CRUD functionality. You can create restaurants you want to try or rate restaruants you have already tried. There is a search page where you can search your database based on certain criteria. There is also a "Random" page where you can search for a random restaurant based on criteria.

## Technologies used

Include: React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL and Styled-Components for styling.
